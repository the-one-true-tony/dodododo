# Lyrics Hero *formerly known as Doodoodoodoo*

What's that song that goes like this? Doo doo doo doo?

If it isn't clear (probably not) Lyrics Hero is a precision timing and typing game that plays homage to the amazing song Darude - Sandstorm.  

Players will type the first letter of the word that comes up in the song as it's being played.  The letters will scroll from the right side of the screen to the left.  Once the letter reaches the middle of the input box, the player should type that letter.

The rules are simple:

1) Type the letter when the letter reaches the middle of the input box, and/or listen to the beat.
2) The more times you accomplish that (not easy) the more points your score.

## Technologies

This project was made solely from Vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML.

Some technical challenges in this game involve timing the beats of the song and syncing them to the scrolling letters. Additionally, the particle effects were created with HTML canvas and required parameters to simulate a gravitational effect.
